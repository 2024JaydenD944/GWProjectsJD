<p>Welcome to this website, a quick website that I  have created to show you what my game is about. The game is called Falling Spike (game) and the main point of the game is to dodge the spikes to earn points. The goal of the game is to stay alive, dodge as much spikes that are quickly falling from the sky. You are the stick figure, quickly evade for as long as you can. The longer you stay alive, the more points you earn.</p>
