<h1>How To Play</h1>
<p>This game is fairly simple to play, so it should be easy to learn. When you click start to play the game, you are the little stick figure avatar. You may see falling pencils coming from the sky, DO NOT LET THEM HIT YOU! If you get hit by even one, you will die. You would have to restart the game and reset your points. The longer you stay alive, dodging the sharp pencils. The more points you will earn. You will only need a mouse or a touchpad for this game, no keyboard needed. Hold left click to move the avatar left and right to dodge the spikes (pencils).</p>
